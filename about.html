    <h1 id="about-page">About</h1>
    <p>
      From May 28 to June 17, 2024, I stayed at <a href="https://www.campfr.com/">Camp FR</a>, an artist residency in Aulus-les-Bains, a small town in the south of France. During that time, I took part in two workshops: one on ecoacoustics with <a href="https://profiles.sussex.ac.uk/p127749-alice-eldridge"> Alice Eldridge </a> and <a href="https://cense.earth/grant-smith"> Grant Smith </a>, and another on field recording with <a href="https://cense.earth/raquel-castro"> Raquel Castro </a> and Joseph Kamaru <a href="https://kmru.info/">(KMRU)</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over those weeks, I listened closely to the world around me and experimented with different microphones to capture it.
    </p>
    <p>
      My time in Aulus brought me back to a childlike sense of play and wonder. Yes, I was thinking about what it means to record sound, why it matters to listen to nature, to pay attention. But I also spent days making up games and running around with my camp bestie, <a href="https://www.hazelreeves.com/experimental">Hazel Reeves</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through this project, I want to share that wonder with youâ€”and express my gratitude to the town of Aulus-les-Bains and the people who run Camp FR.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you for listening.
